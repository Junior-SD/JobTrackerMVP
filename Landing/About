            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>This project was inspired by my own experience of job hunting after completing my studies. I struggled to keep track of all the applications I submitted and their status, so I decided to create a solution to streamline the process.</p>
            <p>This is a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, created with the aim of showcasing my skills in web development.</p>
